# builder-portal

The Builder Portal will be a web interface for uploading and managing mini-apps.
It currently contains no source code, but when implemented it will likely be a
Node/React application.

## Running locally (when code exists)

```bash
cd builder-portal
npm install
npm start
```

The portal will help package your app and publish its `manifest.json` so that the
Catalog API can serve it.
