# catalog-api

This directory is reserved for the service that will expose a catalog of
available mini-apps. The API will serve the `manifest.json` files so the host
application can discover and load apps.

## Running locally (when code exists)

```bash
cd catalog-api
npm install
npm start
```

At the moment there is no implementation, but this folder documents where the
Catalog API will live.
